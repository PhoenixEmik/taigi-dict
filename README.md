## Tech Stack

- Flutter
- `shared_preferences` for user preferences, search history, bookmarks, and theme persistence
- `just_audio` for local audio playback
- `path_provider` for offline archive storage

## Project Structure

The app is no longer a single large `main.dart`. It is split by responsibility:

- `lib/main.dart`: app entry point and exports used by tests
- `lib/app/`: app bootstrap, shell, and theme configuration
- `lib/core/`: shared app-wide state such as persisted preferences
- `lib/features/dictionary/`: dictionary models, search logic, screens, and widgets
- `lib/features/bookmarks/`: bookmark persistence and bookmarks screen
- `lib/features/settings/`: settings screen and settings widgets
- `lib/features/audio/`: offline audio archive storage, playback, and diagnostics
- `lib/offline_audio.dart`: compatibility export for audio types/services
- `tool/build_dictionary_asset.py`: converts the upstream ODS into the bundled gzip JSON asset
- `data/source/kautian.ods`: local copy of the ministry source spreadsheet

## Regenerate Dictionary Data

If the upstream ODS changes, rebuild the packaged dictionary asset:

```bash
python3 tool/build_dictionary_asset.py
```

## Run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Verify

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## Build Release APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## Delivery Notes

- Android and iOS app display names are set to `台語辭典`.
- The project still needs production application identifiers before store release.
- Release signing is not configured in this repository. Add your own Android keystore and Apple signing settings before publishing.
