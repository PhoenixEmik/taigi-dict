# 台語辭典

Flutter dictionary app for Taiwanese Hokkien and Mandarin on Android and iOS.
The app is built around the Ministry of Education dataset, supports offline
lookup, and downloads large offline resources directly to the user's device.

## App Identity

- Dart package name: `taigi_dict`
- App display name: `台語辭典`
- Android application ID: `org.taigidict.app`
- iOS bundle identifier: `org.taigidict.app`
- Official project domain: `https://taigidict.org`
- Production asset host: `https://app.taigidict.org/assets/`

## Current Features

- Offline dictionary lookup for Taiwanese headwords, Tailo romanization, and Mandarin definitions
- Weighted search ranking with optional background-isolate execution
- Bookmark tab for saved entries
- Search history stored locally with `shared_preferences`
- Dedicated word detail screen with native share support
- Interactive linked definitions that can open referenced entries inline
- Offline audio archive downloads for 詞目音檔 and 例句音檔
- Pause / resume / breakpoint-resume downloads for large ZIP files using `dio` + HTTP range requests
- Offline dictionary source download for `kautian.ods`
- On-device SQLite database build from the downloaded ODS file using `spreadsheet_decoder` and `sqflite`
- Localized UI for Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English
- Runtime Traditional/Simplified Chinese conversion using the native OpenCC engine with Taiwanese phrase-aware configs
- Accessibility improvements for semantics labels, merged semantics on complex settings tiles, and localized tooltips
- Platform-adaptive UI: Android keeps the app's branded Material palette, while iOS uses Cupertino navigation and Liquid Glass surfaces
- Reading text size adjustment and system-aware light / dark / AMOLED theme selection
- Bundled `TauhuOo` fallback font for CJK Ext-C/D/E glyph coverage when the system font is missing characters

## Data And Licensing

Canonical ministry references:

- Dictionary reference: `https://sutian.moe.edu.tw/zh-hant/siongkuantsuguan/`
- Source spreadsheet: `https://sutian.moe.edu.tw/media/senn/ods/kautian.ods`
- Tailo guide: `https://sutian.moe.edu.tw/zh-hant/piantsip/tailo-phiautsu-suatbing/`
- Hanji usage guide: `https://sutian.moe.edu.tw/zh-hant/piantsip/hanji-iongji-guantsik/`

Production offline resource endpoints used by the app:

- Dictionary audio archive: `https://app.taigidict.org/assets/sutiau-mp3.zip`
- Example audio archive: `https://app.taigidict.org/assets/leku-mp3.zip`
- Raw dictionary source: `https://app.taigidict.org/assets/kautian.ods`

Important distribution note:

- Because the upstream raw data is under `CC BY-ND 3.0 TW`, the app does not ship a preconverted SQLite database.
- Instead, the app downloads the raw `kautian.ods` file and builds the local SQLite database on the user's device.
- Runtime dictionary loading now prefers the locally built SQLite database in the app support directory. The old packaged dictionary asset is no longer used by the production app runtime.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter
- `dio` for resumable downloads
- `just_audio` for offline audio playback
- `flutter_open_chinese_convert` for runtime OpenCC conversion
- `liquid_glass_widgets` for iOS-style Liquid Glass surfaces
- `path` and `path_provider` for local file management
- `shared_preferences` for user settings, bookmarks, and search history
- `share_plus` for native sharing
- `spreadsheet_decoder` for parsing `kautian.ods`
- `sqflite` for the local SQLite dictionary database

## Project Structure

- `lib/main.dart`: app entry point
- `lib/app/`: app shell, navigation, and theme bootstrap
- `lib/core/`: constants, localization, translation, and shared preferences
- `lib/features/dictionary/`: dictionary models, search, SQLite build/load logic, and UI
- `lib/features/audio/`: offline audio archive download, indexing, and playback
- `lib/features/bookmarks/`: bookmark persistence and screens
- `lib/features/settings/`: settings UI, offline resource controls, and localized reference articles
- `lib/features/settings/presentation/content/reference_articles.dart`: localized Tailo and Hanji reference article content
- `tool/build_dictionary_asset.py`: Python conversion script kept as a reference for the Dart-side ODS-to-SQLite mapping logic

## Run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Verify

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## iOS Setup

The iOS project is configured with:

- deployment target `iOS 13.0`
- localized app metadata for `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans`, and `en`
- adaptive iOS UI surfaces using Cupertino navigation plus `liquid_glass_widgets`

After dependency or Pod changes:

```bash
flutter pub get
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Build Release APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

Generated artifact:

- `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

Current release-build caveat:

- Android `release` still uses the debug signing config so local release APKs can be installed for testing.
- Configure your own Android keystore and Apple signing settings before store distribution.

## UI Notes

- iOS uses adaptive Cupertino navigation, glass bottom bars, glass search bars, and glass settings sections.
- Android intentionally does not reuse the iOS palette; it keeps the app's warmer branded Material styling for better platform fit.

## License

- App code: MIT. See `LICENSE`.
- Dictionary data: `CC BY-ND 3.0 TW`. See `DATA_LICENSE.md`.
- Dictionary audio: derived from the same ministry source and remains separately licensed under the upstream terms.
